Abstract

Urban areas are characterized by the very high degree of soil sealing
and continuous built-up areas: Italy is the fifth European country with
the highest artificial land cover rate, which causes a substantial
spatial variation in the land surface temperature (LST), modifying the
urban microclimate and contributing to the urban heat island effect.
Nevertheless, quantitative data regarding the contribution of different
densities of built-up surfaces in determining urban spatial LST changes
is currently lacking in Italy. This study, which aimed to provide
synthetic and quantitative city-specific information on annual and
seasonal spatial LST modifications resulting from increased urban
built-up coverage, was conducted generally throughout the whole year,
and specifically in two different periods (cool/cold and warm/hot
periods). Four cities (Milan, Rome, Bologna and Florence) were included
in the study. The LST layer and the built-up-surface indicator were
obtained via use of MODIS remote sensing data products (1 km) and the
very high-resolution cartography (5 m) of built-up surfaces recently
developed by the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection
and Research. The relationships between the dependent (mean daily,
daytime and nighttime LST values) and independent (built-up surfaces)
variables were investigated through linear regression analyses, and
comprehensive built-up-surface-related LST maps were also developed.
Statistically significant linear relationships (p under 0.001) between
built-up surfaces and spatial LST variations were observed in all the
cities studied, with a higher impact during the warm/hot period than in
the cool/cold ones. Daytime and nighttime LST slope patterns depend on
the city size and relative urban morphology. If implemented in the
existing city plan, the urban maps of built-up-surface-related LST
developed in this study might be able to support more sustainable urban
land management practices by identifying the critical areas (Hot-Spots)
that would benefit most from mitigation actions by local authorities,
land-use decision makers, and urban planners.
